                  I built a mathematical model to analyze colorectal cancer cell
                  growth in CRC-on-Chip Microfluidic devices operated by the Mumenthaler Lab.
                  I was advised by Jasmine Foo, working with her and Shannon Mumenthaler.

                  <br>
                  On a technical level, I dug into multitype stochastic branching processes, implementing in
                  Python and MatLab with a maximum likeliestimation algorithm to optimize parameters,
                  allowing me to determine the cells' rates of birth, death, and phenotypic switching.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  I collaborated with the Mumenthaler Lab in designing experiments
                  to ensure the data they collected was maximally informative
                  and encapsulated the important biological aspects of their setup.

                I designed and taught courses in calculus 1, calculus 2, and
                linear algebra for University of Minnesota Undergraduates.
                <br><br>
                As one of the first points of contact of students with the university, I also helped them
                learn to navigate the university system.
                <br><br>
                Due to the wide range of studetn educational backgrounds, I
                had to make sure everyone could learn and understand the
                material while not leaving any students bored.
                <br><br>
                In my teaching philosophy, I place particular emphasis on
                the fact that, due to our range of knowledge and interests,
                aspects of mathematics that come quickly to some may be less
                comprehensible to others, and vice versa.

                  I have taught at IDEA MATH and Star League summer and winter math camps to help
                  talented, highly motivated high school students succeed at mathematics competitions.
                  <br><br>
                  I prepared and presented materials in geometry and combonatorics,
                  designed challenging quizzes, and provided stylistic feedback to hone their math presentation skills.
                  In my presentations, I contextualized complex problem solving techniques so the students could
                  more easily recognize when these methods could be applicable vs. when to try something different.
                  <br><br>
                  Many alumni of this program, including my students,
                  have gone on to win national math competitions.
